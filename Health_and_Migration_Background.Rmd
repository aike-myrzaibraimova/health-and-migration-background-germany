# **INTRODUCTION**

![](https://www.gesundheit.bremen.de/sixcms/media.php/172/thumbnails/Gesundheit%20und%20Migration.png.62408.png)

The Migration Report by the Federal Commissioner for Migration,
Refugees, and Integration (2010) proposes the following definition of
"migration": "Migration is when a person relocates the center of their
life. We speak of international migration when this happens across
national borders. International migration to and from Germany includes
immigration and emigration across the country's borders (external
migration)."[@migratio

In Germany, almost 20 % of the population have a migration background
(i.e., have migrated themselves or are descendants of immigrants),
totaling about 16 million individuals.[@statisti

Individuals with a migration background may face higher health risks
compared to the majority population without a migration
background[@migrund]. However, it is not migration itself that leads to
poorer health. Rather, it is the reasons and circumstances surrounding
migration, as well as the living and working conditions of people with a
migration background in Germany, that can contribute to worse health
outcomes.

People with a migration background face increased risks for certain
health issues that are more rare in the German population, including:

-   Deaths related to childbirth and the first year of life
-   Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases
-   Some rare hereditary metabolic disorders

Additionally, people with a migration background are exposed to specific
health risks that are not commonly experienced by Germans without a
migration background, such as:

-   Psychosocial stress due to separation from family
-   Psychosocial stress due to xenophobia
-   Political persecution or torture in their country of origin
    [@migrund]

Nonetheless, people with a migration background are not inherently
'sicker' than Germans without a migration background. In fact, they
often possess significant health-promoting resources. For instance,
those who undertake the challenge of migration are often particularly
healthy and active, exhibiting a so-called "healthy migrant effect". The
"healthy migrant" effect can create an illusion of unusually good health
among immigrants. Accurately accounting for this effect in data
interpretation is challenging. For instance, the lower mortality rates
from heart attacks among immigrants from southern and western
Mediterranean regions could be attributed to the significantly lower
heart attack mortality rates in their home countries compared to
Germany, rather than any selection effects related to
migration[@healthy].

#**METHODOLOGY**

## Data Source

The German Socio-Economic Panel
[(SOEP)](https://www.diw.de/documents/dokumentenarchiv/17/diw_01.c.604430.de/soep_flyer_2018_en.pdf)
study provides extensive microdata for research in the social, economic,
and behavioral sciences. Similar to a powerful telescope offering
detailed views to researchers globally, SOEP serves as a crucial
observatory for social phenomena. Its data support not only fundamental
academic research but also social policy reports intended for a broader
audience.

[SOEP-Core](http://companion.soep.de/#), the main component of the
Socio-Economic Panel, is based at the German Institute for Economic
Research (DIW Berlin). It began in 1984 and was notably expanded in 1990
to include East Germany's representative sample following German
reunification, a feature that distinguishes SOEP among global household
panel surveys. Since 1984, SOEP’s fieldwork organization, infas Institut
für angewandte Sozialwissenschaften GmbH, has surveyed individuals from
participating households. The data encompasses every household member,
including Germans from both former East and West Germany, foreign
residents, recent immigrants, and a new sample of refugees added in
2016. Topics covered include household composition, education,
occupational history, employment, earnings, health, and indicators of
satisfaction.

## Choice of Variables: Migration Background

The following variables were chosen to represent Migration Background:

1.  [ppathl/migback](https://paneldata.org/soep-core/datasets/ppathl/migback):
    Migration background.
2.  [ppathl/immiyear](https://paneldata.org/soep-core/datasets/ppathl/immiyear):
    Year Moved to Germany.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Variable 1
migration_backgrounds <- c(
  "1" = "no migration background",
  "2" = "direct migration background",
  "3" = "indirect migration background")
# Without drop_na() 605,995 observations, with: same
M1_MigBack <- read_dta("ppathl.dta", col_select = c(pid, syear, migback)) %>% 
  filter(migback > -1) %>%
  mutate(migback_description = migration_backgrounds[as.character(migback)]) %>% 
  drop_na()

# Variable 2
M4_ImmiYear <- read_dta("ppathl.dta", col_select = c(pid, syear, immiyear)) %>% 
  filter(immiyear > -1) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

## Choice of Variables: Health

The following variables were chosen to represent Health:

1.  [ple0008](https://paneldata.org/soep-core/datasets/pl/ple0008):
    Current Health.
2.  [ple0072](https://paneldata.org/soep-core/datasets/pl/ple0072):
    Number Of Doctor Visits Last Three Mths.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Variable 1
H1_StateOfHealth <- read_dta("pl.dta", col_select = c(pid, syear, ple0008)) %>% 
  filter(ple0008 > -1) %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(StateOfHealth = case_when(
    ple0008 == 1 ~ "Very good",
    ple0008 == 2 ~ "Good",
    ple0008 == 3 ~ "Satisfactory",
    ple0008 == 4 ~ "Less good",
    ple0008 == 5 ~ "Poor"
  ))

# Variable 2
H3_DoctorVisits <- read_dta("pl.dta", col_select = c(pid, syear, ple0072)) %>% 
  filter(ple0072 > -1) %>% 
  drop_na() 
```

## Data Sampling

-   Variables chosen for the current analysis come from two datasets:
    [pl](https://paneldata.org/soep-core/datasets/pl/) and
    [ppathl](https://paneldata.org/soep-core/datasets/ppathl/).

-   All variables chosen were filtered to not include invalid answers
    (e.g. values equaling -1 to -8) and to not include missing values
    (using the function `drop_na()`).

-   Datasets used for analysis were created by merging the time-constant
    information on individuals such as Never Changing Person ID (`pid`),
    Gender (`sex`) and the time-varying information from individuals
    such as survey Year (`syear`).

-   For all years since 1984, the PPATHL dataset contains information on
    all persons who have ever lived in a SOEP household when a survey
    was conducted (i.e., all adult respondents as well as children under
    17 years of age and household members who have never given an
    interview). PPATHL is important in distinguishing research units
    (persons), especially for longitudinal analysis.

-   The PL dataset contains all variables from the individual
    questionnaire for all waves. In addition, the individual-specific
    data from the IAB-SOEP Migration Survey and IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee
    Survey are integrated into the PL dataset.


## Data Limitations

-   Subjective Measures: The study includes subjective measures such as
    job satisfaction and social isolation, which rely on individual
    perceptions and self-reported data. These subjective measures are
    inherently variable and influenced by personal experiences and
    reporting biases. As a result, the findings related to these
    measures may reflect individual viewpoints rather than objective
    truths.

-   Sampling Bias: The sample may not capture all demographic or
    socio-economic groups equally. Variations in participation rates
    among different groups could lead to sampling bias, affecting the
    representativeness of the data and the accuracy of the conclusions
    drawn.

-   Missing Data: The dataset contains some variables with substantial
    amounts of missing data or responses marked as invalid. These
    missing values were excluded from the analysis to ensure accuracy.
    However, this exclusion could introduce biases or limit the scope of
    the findings, potentially affecting their generalizability and
    robustness.

## Data Analysis Techniques

1.  Visualizations Between Variables: To gain a comprehensive
    understanding of the relationships and patterns within the data, a
    variety of visualizations were employed.

2.  Descriptive Statistics: To summarize and describe the central
    tendencies and dispersion of the data, several key descriptive
    statistics were calculated. The mean provided the average value of
    each variable, offering a general sense of the typical observation.
    The median was used to identify the midpoint of the data
    distribution, which is particularly useful for understanding the
    center of the data, especially in the presence of outliers. The
    standard deviation (sd) measured the variability or spread of the
    data around the mean, offering insights into the consistency and
    reliability of the observed values.

3.  Statistical Tests: To test hypotheses and assess relationships
    between variables, a range of statistical tests was applied. The
    chi-square test was employed to examine the independence of
    categorical variables, determining whether observed frequencies
    deviated significantly from expected frequencies. Correlation
    analysis was used to assess the strength and direction of linear
    relationships between continuous variables, providing a measure of
    how closely two variables move together.


# **ANALYSIS**

## Relationship 1: Current Health (ple0008) and Migration Background (migback) {.tabset}

The analysis of Relationship 1 is going to attempt to discover and
analyse any differences in self-reported health status between
individuals with migration background and no mogration background.

It is important to note that the data is based on self-reported health
status, which can be subjective.

### Descrtiptive Statistics

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Descriptive statistics for health states and migration background
# Health Variable and MigBack
md1_Health_MigBack <- inner_join(H1_StateOfHealth, M1_MigBack, by = c("pid", "syear")) %>% 
  drop_na()

md1_health_stats <- md1_Health_MigBack %>%
  group_by(migback_description, StateOfHealth) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(migback_description, StateOfHealth)%>%
  group_by(migback_description) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()

kable(md1_health_stats, format = "html",
      col.names = c("Migration Background", "Health State", "Count", "Percentage")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

#### Comparison Across Groups:

-   **"Good" Health**: The "indirect migration background" group has the
    highest percentage of "Good" health (46.3%), followed by "no
    migration background" (40.7%), and then "direct migration
    background" (38.8%).
-   **"Poor" Health**: The "direct migration background" group has the
    highest percentage of "Poor" health (3.8%), followed by "no
    migration background" (3.5%), and then "indirect migration
    background" (1.6%).
-   **"Very Good" Health**: The "no migration background" group has the
    highest percentage of "Very good" health (9.7%), followed by
    "indirect migration background" (22.2%), and then "direct migration
    background" (18.2%).

#### Possible Interpretations:

-   The health gradient across migration backgrounds is not clear-cut.
    While the "direct migration background" group still appears to be at
    a slight disadvantage, particularly regarding "Poor" health, the "no
    migration background" group doesn't consistently exhibit the best
    health outcomes.

-   The "indirect migration background" group stands out with the
    highest percentage of "Good" health and the lowest percentages of
    "Less good" and "Poor" health. This suggests potential protective
    factors or advantages associated with this type of migration
    background.

-   **Potential Explanations for "Indirect Migration Background"
    Advantage**:

    -   Individuals with indirect migration backgrounds may have
        different migration motivations or experiences compared to those
        with direct migration backgrounds, which could influence their
        health.
    -   The process of adapting to a new culture and integrating into
        society might differ for those with indirect migration
        backgrounds, potentially leading to better health outcomes.

### Chi-Squared Test Results

The results of Pearson's Chi-squared test for the association between
"Current Health" and "Migration Background" are as follows:

-   **Chi-Squared Statistic (X-squared)**: `5967.6`
-   **Degrees of Freedom (df)**: `8`
-   **P-value**: `< 2.2e-16`

The chi-squared statistic of `5967.6` reflects a significant difference
between the observed and expected frequencies in the contingency table.
A larger chi-squared value indicates a greater discrepancy from the null
hypothesis, which assumes no association between the variables.

The degrees of freedom for this test, calculated as
$(\text{number of rows} - 1) \times (\text{number of columns} - 1)$, are
$(3 - 1) \times (5 - 1) = 2 \times 4 = 8$. This is based on the 3
migration background categories and 5 health status categories.

The extremely small p-value of `< 2.2e-16` is much smaller than
conventional significance levels (e.g., 0.05). This indicates a
statistically significant association between health status and
migration background. In other words, the distribution of health status
categories is not independent of migration background categories; there
is likely a meaningful relationship between them.

While the chi-squared test confirms an association, it does not imply
causation or reveal the direction or nature of the relationship.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
md1_contingency_table <- table(md1_Health_MigBack$migback_description, md1_Health_MigBack$StateOfHealth)
md1_prop_table <- prop.table(md1_contingency_table, margin = 1)

md1_chisq_result <- chisq.test(md1_contingency_table)
print(md1_chisq_result)
```

### Analysis by Gender: Direct Migration Background Health. Visualisation

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
mig_backgrounds <- c(
  "1" = "no migration background",
  "2" = "direct migration background",
  "3" = "indirect migration background")
M1_Gendered_DirMigBack <- read_dta("ppathl.dta", col_select = c(pid, syear, migback, sex)) %>% 
  filter(migback == 2) %>%  # Filter for direct migration background only
  filter(sex > -1) %>% 
  mutate(
    migback_description = mig_backgrounds[as.character(migback)],
    sex_description = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female")) %>% 
  drop_na()

M1_combined_data <- M1_Gendered_DirMigBack %>%
  inner_join(H1_StateOfHealth, by = c("pid", "syear"))
M1_combined_data_plot <- M1_combined_data %>%
  mutate(StateOfHealth = factor(StateOfHealth, levels = c("Very good", "Good", "Satisfactory", "Less good", "Poor"), ordered = TRUE))

M1_health_summary <- M1_combined_data_plot %>%
  group_by(syear, sex_description, StateOfHealth) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

ggplot(M1_health_summary, aes(x = syear, y = count, color = sex_description, group = sex_description)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ StateOfHealth, scales = "free_y", ncol=1) +
  labs(
    title = "State of Health by Gender for Individuals with Direct Migration Background Over the Years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Count",
    color = "Gender") +
  ylim(0, 1500) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10), 
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  
    legend.position = "bottom", 
    legend.box = "horizontal", 
    legend.margin = margin(t = 5))
```

#### Gender Comparisons

-   **Females** consistently report slightly higher counts in the "Very
    good" and "Good" health categories compared to males.
-   **Males** have slightly higher counts in the "Less good" and "Poor"
    categories.
-   The differences between genders are relatively small but consistent
    across the years.

#### Specific Observations

-   **"Satisfactory"** is the most common health status reported by both
    genders, with counts remaining relatively stable over time.
-   The **"Poor"** category has the lowest counts for both genders,
    indicating that a relatively small proportion of individuals report
    poor health.
-   There is a slight increase in the **"Satisfactory"** category for
    both genders towards the end of the period (closer to 2020).
-   There is a slight decrease in the **"Less good"** category for both
    genders towards the end of the period.

#### Possible Interpretations

-   The stable trends suggest that the overall health status of
    individuals with a direct migration background has not changed
    significantly over the 20 years studied.
-   The slight gender differences may indicate that females tend to
    perceive their health slightly more positively than males.
-   The increase in the **"Satisfactory"** category and decrease in the
    **"Less good"** category towards the end of the period could suggest
    a slight improvement in overall health perception.

### Analysis by Gender: No Migration Background Health. Visualisation

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
mig_back <- c(
  "1" = "no migration background",
  "2" = "direct migration background",
  "3" = "indirect migration background")
M1_Gendered_NoMigBack <- read_dta("ppathl.dta", col_select = c(pid, syear, migback, sex)) %>% 
  filter(migback == 1) %>%  # Filter for no migration background only
  filter(sex > -1) %>% 
  mutate(
    migback_description = mig_back[as.character(migback)],
    sex_description = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female")) %>% 
  drop_na()

M1_1_combined_data <- M1_Gendered_NoMigBack %>%
  inner_join(H1_StateOfHealth, by = c("pid", "syear"))
M1_1_combined_data_plot <- M1_1_combined_data %>%
  mutate(StateOfHealth = factor(StateOfHealth, levels = c("Very good", "Good", "Satisfactory", "Less good", "Poor"), ordered = TRUE))

M1_1_health_summary <- M1_1_combined_data_plot %>%
  group_by(syear, sex_description, StateOfHealth) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

ggplot(M1_1_health_summary, aes(x = syear, y = count, color = sex_description, group = sex_description)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ StateOfHealth, scales = "free_y", ncol=1) +
  labs(
    title = "State of Health by Gender for Individuals with No Migration Background Over the Years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Count",
    color = "Gender") +
  ylim(0, 3000) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10), 
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  
    legend.position = "bottom", 
    legend.box = "horizontal", 
    legend.margin = margin(t = 5))
```

Both graphs show a similar pattern of overall stability in health status
across the 20 years for both genders, with no drastic fluctuations. The
"Satisfactory" category remains the most prevalent health status for
both genders, regardless of migration background. Similarly, the "Poor"
health category consistently has the lowest counts in both populations.

Both graphs reveal a consistent gender gap. Females tend to report
better health more often ("Very good" and "Good"), while males have
slightly higher counts in poorer health categories ("Less good" and
"Poor").

#### Key Differences

-   **Higher "Very Good" & "Good" in No Migration Group:** Individuals
    *without* a migration background report "Very good" and "Good"
    health significantly more often than those *with* a migration
    background. This gap is particularly noticeable in the "Very good"
    category and is consistent across the timeline.
-   **"Satisfactory" More Common with Migration:** The "Satisfactory"
    category, while dominant in both groups, is notably more prevalent
    among individuals with a migration background.
-   **"Less Good" & "Poor" More Common with Migration:** Conversely, the
    "Less good" and "Poor" categories, though still less frequent
    overall, have consistently higher counts in the group with a
    migration background.

## Relationship 2. Doctor Visits (ple0072) by Migration Background (migback). {.tabset}

By analyzing Relationship 2 we will investigate if individuals with and
without migration backgrounds differ in their use of healthcare services
(here, doctor visits in the last three months).

### Visualisation

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Healthcare Utilization with Migration Background
md2_Healthcare_MigData <- merge(H3_DoctorVisits, M1_MigBack, by = c("pid", "syear"))
# A boxplot

  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "red", outlier.shape = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Doctor Visits by Migration Background",
    x = "Migration Background",
    y = "Number of Doctor Visits"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
    theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 8), 
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  
    legend.position = "bottom", 
    legend.box = "horizontal", 
    legend.margin = margin(t = 5))
```

#### Key Observations

1.  **Median Number of Visits:**
    -   **Direct migration background:** The median number of doctor
        visits appears to be the lowest among the three groups. The
        median line within the box is closer to the bottom of the box.
    -   **Indirect migration background and No migration background:**
        These two groups seem to have a similar median number of visits,
        with the median line located around the middle of their
        respective boxes.
2.  **Spread of the Data (Interquartile Range - IQR):**
    -   **Direct migration background:** The IQR (the height of the box)
        for this group is relatively small, suggesting that the middle
        50% of individuals with a direct migration background have a
        similar number of doctor visits.
    -   **Indirect & No migration background:** Both of these groups
        show a larger IQR compared to the direct migration background
        group. This indicates more variability in the number of doctor
        visits among individuals in these groups.
3.  **Outliers:**
    -   **All three groups** exhibit outliers, represented by the
        individual points beyond the whiskers.
    -   **Direct migration background:** While having the smallest IQR,
        this group appears to have a few outliers on the higher end,
        indicating some individuals with a direct migration background
        have a notably high number of doctor visits.
    -   **Indirect & No migration background:** These groups have a
        number of outliers, particularly on the higher end, suggesting
        some individuals within these groups visit doctors considerably
        more frequently than others.

#### Possible Interpretations

-   Individuals with a direct migration background may tend to utilize
    healthcare services (as measured by doctor visits) less frequently
    compared to those with an indirect migration background or no
    migration background.

-   The presence of outliers highlights the importance of considering
    individual circumstances and avoiding generalizations. There are
    individuals within each group who deviate from the general trend,
    potentially due to specific health conditions or other factors.

### Descriptive Statistics

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Healthcare Utilization with Migration Background
md2_Healthcare_MigData <- merge(H3_DoctorVisits, M1_MigBack, by = c("pid", "syear"))
md2_descriptive_table <- md2_Healthcare_MigData %>%
  group_by(migback_description) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean_Doctor_Visits = mean(ple0072, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Doctor_Visits = sd(ple0072, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )
kable(md2_descriptive_table, format = "html", 
      col.names = c("Migration Background", "Mean Doctor Visits", "SD of Doctor Visits", "Count")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")

```

#### Analysis Incorporating Descriptive Statistics

1.  **Mean Doctor Visits:**
    -   The table reveals that the mean number of doctor visits is
        highest for those with no migration background (3.587), followed
        by those with a direct migration background (3.561). The
        indirect migration background group exhibits the lowest mean
        (3.213).
    -   This aligns with the boxplot's median observation, where the
        direct migration group appeared to have the lowest median, and
        the other two groups seemed comparable. However, the means
        suggest that the "no migration background" group utilizes
        healthcare services slightly more on average than the "direct
        migration background" group.
2.  **Standard Deviation (SD) of Doctor Visits:**
    -   The "direct migration background" group, despite having the
        lowest mean, shows a relatively high SD (4.611), indicating
        greater dispersion around the mean. This aligns with the
        outliers seen in the boxplot for this group, suggesting a wider
        range of healthcare utilization behaviors.
    -   The "indirect migration background" group has the lowest SD
        (3.929), suggesting less variability in doctor visits compared
        to the other two groups.
    -   The "no migration background" group's SD (4.429) lies between
        the other two, reinforcing the observation of moderate
        variability in their healthcare utilization.

#### Enhanced Interpretations

-   **Direct vs. No Migration Background:** While the boxplot suggested
    lower healthcare utilization for the "direct migration background"
    group based on the median, the mean values indicate their usage is
    closer to the "no migration background" group. The higher SD for the
    "direct migration background" group further suggests a more diverse
    range of healthcare-seeking behaviors within this group.

-   **Indirect Migration Background:** The "indirect migration
    background" group, with the lowest mean and SD, appears to have the
    least frequent and most consistent pattern of doctor visits among
    the three groups.

# **CONCLUSION**

Individuals with a migration background in Germany encounter unique
health challenges stemming from their migration experiences and
circumstances. However, it is essential to recognize that these
individuals are not inherently less healthy. Addressing health
challenges requires a nuanced understanding of the factors contributing
to them and a focus on improving the living conditions and support
systems for migrants in Germany.

By running analysis on realtionship between different variables
representing Health and Migration Background, we delved into a vast
topic of "Migration and Health". Future studies could explore more
granular aspects of how migration experiences impact health outcomes and
identify effective strategies for improving migrant health. Such
research could provide valuable insights for policymakers and healthcare
providers, ultimately leading to better support systems and health
outcomes for migrants in Germany and beyond.
